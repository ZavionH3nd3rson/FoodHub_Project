# FoodHub_Project
Used python and statistics to develop a strategy and execute the best plan of action on interpreting which restaurants had the highest demand from their customer base. Used my skills with python to perform data visualizations and uni/bi-variate analysis on the dataset to help me reach my concluding arguments on the FoodHub analysis.
